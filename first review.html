    <P style="text-indent: 3%; ">Alluvial soils are formed by the deposition of silt by the rivers. It is most fertile as it is rich in minerals such as lime, potassium, magnesium, nitrogen, 
        and phosphoric acid but it is deficient in nitrogen and phosphoric acid.It is porous and loamy. The supported crops are Paddy, sugarcane, banana, and turmeric. 
        Basically, it is found along river valleys and coastal plains of Tamil Nadu.</P>
    <P>It is found in the districts of Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Villupuram, Cuddalore, Tirunelveli, and Kanyakumari, and to along the river valleys in a few interior districts.
        The Tamil Nadu Agriculture University site did not mention alluvial soil percentage, but it should be somewhere around 3 to 6%.

    <P style="text-indent: 3%;">Black soil is formed by the weathering of igneous rocks. It is also called Regur Soil. This is developed over the Deccan lava granite region under semiarid conditions.
        It is fine textured and clayey in nature, it is poor in phosphoric acid, nitrogen, and organic matter. The main minerals found in this soil are calcium, magnesium, carbonates, potash, and lime.
        As cotton grows well in it, it is also called black cotton soil. The major crops cultivated in it are Cotton, sorghum, cumbu, and fodder crops.</P>

        <p>Also, it is one of the important types of soil found in Tamilnadu as it occupies 12% of total soils. The black clayey alluvium rich soil is known as black cotton soil which is found in parts of Coimbatore, Madurai, Dindigul, Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli and in patches in the districts of Kancheepuram, Vellore, Salem, Dharmapuri, Ramanathapuram, Virudunagar and the Nilgiris.
        It is distributed across the districts of Coimbatore, Madurai, Virudhunagar, Tirunelveli, and Thoothukudi.</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 3%;">Red soils cover over two-thirds of the total area of Tamilnadu. It is found mostly in the central districts of the state. It is sandy and loamy in texture. However, the characteristics of red soils change based on their formation and the climatic condition under which it is formed.

        It is porous, friable, and non-retentive of moisture. It is red in colour due to the presence of a high concentration of Iron oxides.</p>
    <p>lt is poor nitrogen, phosphorus acid, and humus. Almost all the crops can be cultivated in it with the application of manure and irrigation facilities.

        It is the most important type of soil found in Tamilnadu, as it is present 62% in Tamilnadu. It is distributed in the districts of Sivagangai, Ramanathapuram, etc.
        The crops grown in its are Paddy, Ragi, Tobacco, and Vegetables.</p><br>
    <h2>The red soil are further classified as:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Red loamy (30 per cent)</li>
        <li>Red sterile (6 per cent)</li>
        <li>Red-sandy (6 per cent)</li>
        <li>Thin red (2 per cent) </li>

    <p style="text-indent: 3%;">Laterite is derived from the Latin word 'Later' which means brick. This develops in areas where the temperature is high and has high rainfall. It is formed by the process of intense leaching.
        As the rain washes away the lime and silica and it is left with Iron oxide and aluminium compounds.
        Also, its humus content is removed quickly by bacteria that thrive well in high temperatures. As a result, these are poor in organic matter, nitrogen, phosphate, and calcium.</p>

    <p>But it has excess Iron oxide and potash. Hence it is not suitable for agriculture. But by using manures and fertilizers, the cultivation can be made.
        It supports paddy, ginger, pepper, cashew nut, and plantains. Also, it is suitable for the cultivation of tea and coffee plants. Also, it is widely used to cut bricks for construction.
        It is found in some parts of the Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, and Thanjavur districts. Also in the mountainous region in the Nilgiris.</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 3%;">It contains a large proportion of sodium, potassium, and magnesium as a result they are infertile and do not support vegetative growth. Also, it lacks nitrogen and calcium.
        Because of poor drainage and dry climate, they have more salts. Its nature ranges from sandy to loamy.
        Seawater intrusion in deltas promotes saline soils. Also in the area that promotes intensive agriculture using intensive irrigation saline soil is formed due to capillarity action that brings salts to the top.</p>
    <p>To solve the problems of salinity, the farmer is advised to use Gypsum in the soil.
        These are confined to the Coromandel coast. Saline soils in Tamil Nadu are confined to the Coromandel coast. Vedaranyam has a pocket of saline soil.
        However, the tsunami waves on December 26, 2004, brought a lot of sand and deposited it all along the east coast of Tamil Nadu. The tsunami made the coastal areas unsuitable for cultivation to a considerable extent.</p><br>
